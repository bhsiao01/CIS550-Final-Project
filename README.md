# CIS550-Final-Project

To run our app, we'll need to start the server and run the frontend:
  1. In one terminal, `cd` into `final-project/server` and run `npm install`. When the packages are finished installing, run `node index.js`.
  2. Open another terminal and in `final-project/client`, run `npm install`. When the packages are finished installing, run `npm run start`.
Open `localhost:3000` in your browser and the app should be running!
